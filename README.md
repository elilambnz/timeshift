This project was created as a part of the [Supabase Open Source Hackathon 2024](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-oss-hackathon).

Timeshift is an app that enables you to view the current time of people in different timezones. It is built using [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) as the backend and [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) as the frontend.
